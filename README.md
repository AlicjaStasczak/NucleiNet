# NucleoNet
NucleiNet is a web-based application for cell nucleus segmentation and quantitative analysis of microscopy images. Built with Python and Streamlit, it supports single images and multi-frame stacks, combines classical image processing with U-Net–based deep learning, and enables interactive analysis, batch processing, and metric export.
